# Belly Button Biodiversity

The purpose of this challenge was to use JavaScript's d3 and Plotly libraries to display data dynamically in a dashboard on a webpage. Participants in a scientific study had samples taken from their navel (aka bellybutton, aka belly hole) and were given an ID number that they can check to see which type of bacteria in their belly button.

## Why Would Someone Study This?
Honestly, I have no idea why someone would study this, but apparently it was because these "scientists" wanted to see if they could find a new flavor for tasty new fake meat in these bacteria. Anyway, I chose to ignore this part and just make the dashboard. You can see the dashboard below.
